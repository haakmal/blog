This was partly because I would have something to quickly write about while it was still fresh in my mind, but also so I could stick to a habit of writing. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a schedule in mind for how often I intend to post here (yet), but I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that with these first few technical posts I can get in the swing of it better.\nWhile writing this I quickly realised I had a lot more to say! There is a backstory here, a process to the madness that ends in my writing setup so I will have to break this up into pieces now. This is the first post in a multi-part series about my \u0026lsquo;writing environment\u0026rsquo; which itself is rather broad since I jump between multiple programs and also work across different platforms. I own a Windows machine but oddly in the office I\u0026rsquo;ve always been given MacOS. While that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much difference in terms of this setup, it has meant that I\u0026rsquo;ve had to find systems that were cross platform from the start. A lot of trial and error has gone into what I\u0026rsquo;m still developing here but my current setup is in many ways sustainable (for me at least).\nThe breakdown Everything that I mention in this series can be repurposed as you like, these platforms are all FOSS after all. I plan on covering a number of topics ahead with some posts being about the build up and background, while others more technical. Since my approach towards writing and ultimately knowledge management are tied into developing your own ethos I see this series as jumping between research and life skills. Hopefully whoever reads it may find some benefit. Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of how I see this unfolding:\nWhy should knowledge management matter? (this post) Creating a knowledge management hub with Obsidian (soon) Setting up a blog using Hugo and Git (soon) Some additional content I plan to work on ahead around Obsidian and workflows include using Obsidian for pedagogy, as a student, and also as a cross collaborative research hub with Git.\nThe woes and wants of knowledge management In my last post I went on about how there is this pressure on academics to write and continue to write in their fields all moving towards that one point of unique knowledge contribution. Having a good clean writing setup that works for you accentuates that experience making it (a) worth while, and (b) dare I say enjoyable. Not that writing isn\u0026rsquo;t fun for some people, but when it comes to academic writing it can get dry. It all starts by being able to gather information that you\u0026rsquo;ve collected through research.\nA trusty notebook and pencil served me well for years and still do. I did always find myself hesitant when taking notes because I would know that down the line I would forget about this note. To me the act of writing something down is in effect adding it to a short-term memory, not necessarily something that I will return or be reminded of. Like many others I too had notebooks full of content that was never realised. Knowledge management starts from there and in most cases often ends there as well which where systems like the one I\u0026rsquo;m describing today may come into play.\nThere are several such systems with the more popular one being the Zettelkasten approach. I just can\u0026rsquo;t manage that, I find it it taxing and complex for my brain to keep track of! To those who have, I see that as impressive and I\u0026rsquo;m very certain you\u0026rsquo;ve reached a point of efficiency that is almost machine like. Those who are not aware of the zettelkasten approach, it was developed by a social scientist Niklas Luhmann in an attempt to over power his productivity.1 I\u0026rsquo;m a very patient person in most cases, but this approach was beyond me.\nHaving a penchant to tinker and get slightly obsessed with the process (as I often do), will certainly help when setting up a writing space that is for all purposes designed to be efficient. That level of tinkering was needed for zettelkasten though the redundancy of tasks made me feel less productive personally. Perhaps I approached it incorrectly and maybe down the line I might try again but in the way I practiced it a zettelkasten approach did not feel necessary; in that regard I\u0026rsquo;d like to think I\u0026rsquo;m somewhere on the edge of this knowledge management spectrum. What I needed was a system that was efficient and worked for my needs without the complexity of having to manage it as well. For some that might be as simple as setting up a Medium account or maybe Blogspot (that is a still a thing right?) with a content management system, for others it may very well be something as focused as Luhmann\u0026rsquo;s approach. For me it needed to be more bespoke and almost automated.\nDoes anything beat a good typewriter? (Source) The perfect setup does not exist I\u0026rsquo;ve gone back and forth multiple times with what the perfect setup is and I even wrote about it before in my post-PhD post, a rather emotional read if I\u0026rsquo;m being honest with not enough information on my actual setup! I do now realise after testing so many different approaches that the perfect setup for anything at all simply does not exist. It\u0026rsquo;s important to accept that. You will be constantly tinkering, forever changing, forever dissatisfied with what you have. But for the moment it will work. There will always be a better version of that software or alternative out there and being ready and accepting of that is key.\nMy interest in setting up the best writing environment started in my Master\u0026rsquo;s, I had a lot of writing to do and Word was nasty (still is). I found the wonders of Markdown around then having only ever used it in forums made in phpBB (does anyone remember that?), now its usage was popping up in lots of applications. GitHub of course had always used MD but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a programmer until much later so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have known. I used Ulysses throughout my MA and loved every bit of it, right up to the point when they decided to adopt a subscription-based model for what is a simplified writing app. The business opportunity aside this was around the time when subscription-based-everything was popping up and if the comments section of this post by the app developers is something to go by it clearly did not sit well with more than just me. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get on board with that no matter how much I loved the software, it was at the end of the day a writing application and without the bells and whistles did what Notepad could do. This company-centric over consumer-centric approach is probably an article on its own, but is the reason why we have a Web 3.0 push towards transparency and decentralisation.\nI had some rebound after Ulysses jumping to Atom for a while then other similar software.2 I even tried Notion for a bit and soon realised that it didn\u0026rsquo;t click. My PhD was entirely done in Atom, every paper, review, poster, and more that I wrote at the time used a custom setup with Pandoc and MD in Atom. This was until I found Obsidian towards the end of my PhD. I really wish I had found this earlier on as I believe it would have changed my approach towards note taking and knowledge management significantly. I also wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had to deal with Atom crashing so much on. I even went rouge in the middle of my journey to find the perfect writing setup and going full text-only in Vim and Emacs and the learning curve hit me hard, I can assure you I\u0026rsquo;m never strolling down that road again.\nNow I use Obsidian every day, for teaching purposes, research, this blog, other writings, musings, and more. I\u0026rsquo;m constantly learning about automating steps as well at a comfortable pace, which is partly why I think this constitutes as close to a perfect setup as I can get right now. The other methods I used were either too restrictive, heavy learning curves, required too much tinkering, or just didn\u0026rsquo;t appeal to me.\nThe purpose of knowledge management This first post in the series is definitely more rant than guide, but is also necessary because as academics we have an obligation to retain information as much as disseminate. Back in my Master\u0026rsquo;s I had not thought I would have gone down the road of academia, I was even offered to continue but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t foresee a path. I wanted to return to industry in my homeland, but Pakistan has always been a difficult market to get into and the doors that opened were different to what I had anticipated. Managing your knowledge is akin to managing your own life in that way. Some things you collect might move into rabbit holes or end up in dead ends while others might birth connections. It is an ethos you develop over time that fits to your rhetoric of what is knowledge and how it should be managed. After all, how do you retain information? Is it a diary you keep? A notepad or some scraps of paper you\u0026rsquo;ve collected over time? We retain information in many ways though very little sticks.\nPeople who follow the zettelkasten approach follow that mantra that retention of information is key to productivity. I don\u0026rsquo;t see it like that, to me thats like the Chinese Room Argument. You can have a dictionary of content but it would be meaningless unless context is applied and maintained. That is where I believe an effective knowledge management system comes into play, and is the kind of system I\u0026rsquo;ve attempted to develop. One with specific purpose beyond retention and towards meaning making.\nThat has been a central premise of much of my own work around design and more-than humanness, the purpose of good design and approaching meaningful futures. Across the many years that I\u0026rsquo;ve been experimenting with different approaches towards knowledge management, I think meaning has always been missing. The purpose has always been retention and it never worked for me. Why is it now that my Obsidian vaults are making sense to me? It certainly has something to do with how the software is elegantly positioned towards tinkering but not in an aggressively programmer focused way. That\u0026rsquo;s what I like about Obsidian, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a programmer to be able to create automated processes in your workflow for instance, because someone in the community has prepared a plugin to help with that!\nThe current setup There are multiple cogs to this machine and I will be breaking down each part of the setup in coming posts, but this is where I currently am with my \u0026lsquo;perfect-ish\u0026rsquo; setup. Obsidian works in vaults which is a fancy name for root folders, this blog is part of a separate vault as is my teaching and research work. There is cloud backup as well as Git facilitated repositories for both collaborative work and automation where needed. I have other vaults as well but this series will focus mostly on these three. This diagram shows how it all works as an overview\nflowchart TB A(Vault); B(Vault); C(Vault) Aa(Student DB); Ab(Pedagogy); Ac(Courses DB) Ba(Concepts); Bb(Writing); Bc(Supervision) Ca(Content); Cb(Structure) Cb-.-\u003eid1([Source Git Repo]) Ca-.-\u003eid2([Public Git Repo]) Bb-.-\u003eid3([Collaborative Git Repo]) subgraph Blog direction LR C--\u003eCa \u0026 Cb end subgraph Research direction LR B--\u003eBa \u0026 Bb \u0026 Bc end subgraph Teaching direction LR A--\u003eAa \u0026 Ab \u0026 Ac end Teaching \u0026 Research===\u003eid((Cloud)) Each vault is self contained and I normally don\u0026rsquo;t need to have them mixing together, though with Obsidian I can cross-access them if I want to. Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s UI is simple and to the point, at the same time there is enough room for making it purposeful. There is an additional layer of automation happening within the vaults themselves to support my workflow, things like maintaining similarly data across for fetching and searching notes. It isn\u0026rsquo;t until each vault is opened and worked in that things start making sense and the connections come together. The need for manual retention is removed through using plugins like Projects, DB Folder, and Dataview all I\u0026rsquo;ll be exploring in a future Obsidian focused post. There are also some quality of life plugins on top of these to take the vaults from being simple text oriented databases to powerful content creation engines.\nI was more or less trying to achieve this same thing through Atom before but was unsuccessful. Ulysses did long-form writing quite well though was not very useful for other everyday work. Atom did several things well but nothing well enough. Obsidian on the other hand gives me enough freedom to actually start managing knowledge, an opportunity to learn from what I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered. The difference is night and day at times.\nIs knowledge management needed? A difficult question in the end. Everyone has a particular workflow that fits them well. I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through several and I\u0026rsquo;m still evolving this one. What I have understood in this time is that retention is not the key but management is, being able to make the connections between gathered knowledge is what matters. A tool like Obsidian might not be for everyone, and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t either. For many a notebook, some post-its, a pencil all works well enough. Once I had started teaching the need to maintain a record of my work became more evident. Keeping track of students for efficient feedback as much as understanding what a decentralised perspective towards pedagogy could be. As an academic I need to write about my pedagogy, I need to write about other things beyond as well. Seeing connections is difficult at times and I hope the current workflow I have is sustainable enough to ease that difficulty. The need for knowledge management should emerge from the intent you have, for me it\u0026rsquo;s teaching, research, and learning. For others it could be anything from keeping track of your life to finally writing that novel you haven\u0026rsquo;t touched for so long.\nMore on Niklas Luhmann here\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSadly the hackable development environment has been archived\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"Mar 17","permalink":"https://blog.hakmal.com/post/why-manage-knowledge/","tags":["academia","writing","life"],"title":"Why should knowledge management matter?"},{"categories":["existence","guide"],"contents":" What is this place? Why hello there! (He says in his best Obi Wan voice)\nWelcome to this blog. As is my cultural tradition I should have something spread out for guests like sweets or a beverage. Bare with me while I gather things here, this is my first post after all and there is still some scaffolding around the place. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is a right of passage in any way, I\u0026rsquo;ve made and forgotten many blogs in the past. I\u0026rsquo;m sincerely hoping this one sticks partly because my career now requires this (or at least that is how I\u0026rsquo;ve come to understand things), but also because I really need to get back into the habit of writing (again for the sake of my career, and some sanity).\nHave some ladoo, apologies if you\u0026rsquo;re diabetic (Source) I\u0026rsquo;m not sure who might end up reading any of this content, but perhaps these collections of words will make sense to others. They may even help me in my research. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re one of my students who has curiously found your way onto this semi-personal space of mine, or an avid researcher by chance whose stumbled here because of my work? Perhaps your just passing by and happened to be curious.\nI like that in all these instances curiosity is the common thread linking everything. My entire life has pretty much been about curiosity and as is the way of time I\u0026rsquo;ve aged, and over this course have realised that the decisions I\u0026rsquo;ve made were always because of curiosity. Why else would anyone enter academia? It\u0026rsquo;s certainly not because of the lavish high-flying celebrity lifestyle I can assure you that! We become teachers, academics, and researchers because we are curious kittens. I\u0026rsquo;d would much like to retain that thread as I continue with my work and hopefully this blog can be a part of that story.\nWhat would I like from this blog? I\u0026rsquo;d like this \u0026lsquo;blog\u0026rsquo; to become something of a repository for my thoughts and practice as an academic. I\u0026rsquo;d like it to also be a repository of possible research explorations that are for a lack of a better word undercooked, perhaps as thought experiments or loose accounts of future possibilities. I\u0026rsquo;d like to use this as a platform for making more sense out of my work and benefit my career. I\u0026rsquo;d like this to be a place for me to let out some steam once in a while and ponder existence, we all need to occasionally after all. I\u0026rsquo;d like to separate my more personal opinions, musings, and rants from the serious work I\u0026rsquo;ve done in the past and plan to do ahead. For those interested I\u0026rsquo;m referring to my Medium blog, one of my previous lacklustre attempts in retaining this written lifestyle. I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to make writing a bigger part of my life through this blog. I used to write profusely before and for those who don\u0026rsquo;t know I\u0026rsquo;ve written multiple short stories, half of a novel, and the beginnings of another one all of course unpublished! This is perhaps one of the bigger reasons why I\u0026rsquo;d like this blog to exist as well, so I can get back into those fictional worlds through this practice. Why does this matter? Should it matter? There is a lot of pressure on academics to write or at least have their opinions out in the world in some form. \u0026ldquo;What is your contribution to the generation of new knowledge?\u0026rdquo;, to paraphrase a question my supervisor asked me in my PhD and one I ask all my research students as well because it matters. This need from the academic life pushes us towards things like keeping blogs, written accounts, recordings or daily thoughts, and more how ever possible.\nShould it matter I ask again? Maybe not, after all when we are doing research is it for the good of knowledge or for that curious itch we have as individuals who foster interest in things? A question I\u0026rsquo;d love to leave hanging in the air for a bit.\nWhat to expect ahead I\u0026rsquo;m planning on writing more often in this space and as mentioned separating content and thoughts. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been interested in organising myself towards efficiency and I\u0026rsquo;ve recently been enamoured by Obsidian a knowledge management app (basically over powered note taking). I highly recommend it, I use it for managing my student information, classwork, research work, and also personal life. In fact, this post I wrote in Obsidian as well. I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely be dropping some of my experiences with knowledge management in here in the coming days.\nThe making of this blog has been a learning activity in itself and I\u0026rsquo;ll certainly share what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned in my next post. As a researcher I\u0026rsquo;ve learned and explored many ways to support my academic journey which will also find a home here. I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s the thing in the end, what to to expect is a very board and vague thing to say or even suggest. Though I also don\u0026rsquo;t like the term \u0026rsquo;expect\u0026rsquo;, it has an air of anticipation, anxiety, even urgency which always makes me uncomfortable. What if whatever comes ahead isn\u0026rsquo;t to your \u0026rsquo;expectations\u0026rsquo; (no pun)?\nI think I\u0026rsquo;ll be playing it by ear. I\u0026rsquo;ve often found that no matter how much you can plan and manage things, things have a tendency of getting away as well.\n","date":"Mar 08","permalink":"https://blog.hakmal.com/post/hello-world/","tags":["life","academia"],"title":"Obligatory 'hello world' post"},{"categories":["existence"],"contents":" Sidebar: This post was originally on Medium before I brought some needed organisation into my life. It is a rant and from a dark past, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it at that.\nThis is me, with an ominous hand over my head. Back then I didn’t know the many meanings of shit that I do today. I was born in Dubai, though not my homeland it was home for me. I didn’t have any relatives per say there as the bulk of the family lived in Pakistan; the motherland. Though I suppose your motherland should be where you are most at home, at the time it was Dubai, over the years it became Pakistan to some extent. Obviously it’s a different dynamic having spent half your life in one environment and then the other in a totally opposite world, but you get used to it mainly because you have people around you who try to make you feel ‘welcomed’.\nBut do they really mean it? I remember growing up in a home foreign from home, whispers of memories with my parents always pressing the notion of family. I remember growing up with this image of these concentric circles in my head on how family functioned, the centre of the circle being you and the closer shapes being your immediate loved ones dispersing out slowly into distant cousins and relatives to that quarter-and-a-half aunt from God knows where trying desperately to wed you off somewhere.\nAs I grew older I realised I could not have been more wrong with this arrangement in my head. Being so far away from the motherland you tend to create wistful imaginings of it, you build upon these dreams from past memories or stories related to you by your loved ones. Images of a world that exists sadly only in your head and the heads of like minded cattle that are closest to you.\nThe ‘you are one of us and therefore welcome among us’, dialog that ensues between parties that have met after many a sunrise, I understood over time to be a farce. One that pushed you off to the side.\nHumans tend to enjoy the subtle art of nitpicking. When you fall off a horse there are two things that run through your mind:\nThe ground is coming at me at an alarming rate therefore I should probably brace myself for impact, and I hope I don’t get trampled over. What you don’t think about is that when you fall off a horse—in this case one you’ve groomed so well for so long—you raise your chances of falling not only on the ground but also on to a world underneath the horse full of horse manure. You see the world for what it truly is, and as you sit there on your newly acquired mushy throne of flies picking out bits from your hair you lift your hand in hopes to find something reaching out to you and see your majestic stead galloping off into the distance.\nI refuse to believe the horse is unaware of its lost passenger, I wouldn’t be surprised to know that they secretly smirk at our unfortunate demise. Perhaps they do it on purpose, but horses aren’t people. I know that from observation, and also I understand if you give a horse an apple he’ll love you for it whereas humans tend to enjoy the subtle art of nitpicking.\nNo, this metaphorical stead in the shape of all your worthless imaginings of relations that you think you can count on when the time is rough not only throws you down when you least expect it, but it also makes sure it leaves a long and wide trail of feaces for you to land on; and being a very tricky beast it also manages to trample over you at the same time.\nThis is me later, when I used to give a shit. See how it’s written on my face? It was around the time I was in mid gallop upon my stead that the ground suddenly looked up at me and said, “Hello! We need to have a chat”. The air rushed by me as I saw the horizon tilt to an angle I was certain it shouldn’t, my crash was of course cushioned by the bed of leftover memories and yesterdays. I realised then these elusive creatures I had grown to accept as relatives and otherwise family members were not concentric circles that supported each others\u0026rsquo; shape or were fashioned out of one another. No, these were like bubbles that popped up around you at random mostly when you needed them least and then burst into a kaleidoscope of colours that skittered away instantaneously leaving the world empty, barren, and monotone.\nThe world always was that way, it’s just the fake lens they placed before you that tricked you into imagining it different.\nWhen family deserts, you’re left with an odd expression on your face. It’s half between a look of abject confusion and what I understand to be best described as ‘oh no you did not’.\nThere is a looming threat of anger with the occasional vein popping somewhere on your body. Once you’ve gathered the courage to stand up from the now evident forever on-going road of shit that they’ve left behind you force yourself to come to terms with this revelation.\nIt might seem like the end and there’s always the whole, “I’m ending this chapter once and for all!” moment you go through, but sadly from then on it’s not necessarily smooth sailing.\nThis is me laterer than later, as you can see it’s both fifteen past six and a quarter to eight. I clearly do not give a shit here. It’s the subtle things that make the difference you see. Through my years of observation I’ve also come to conclude that relatives have an inherent ability to poke and pry in your business. I’d love to write on the art of being a twat someday, but I’m afraid in order to go into the details of how one comes around to becoming said abomination, I’d have to spend a whole lot more time around said people in order to study them some more! Luckily I’ve grown weary of all forms of twatery that humans have proved themselves capable of.\nThey poke, they pry, they stick their nose in and rub it around sniffing out what they can. They throw words at you which form mystical sentences a kin to advice, yet you never asked for any. They paint magical worlds in your head where actions no longer take shape the way they did in your memories but instead act out a new script, to you the audience in this theatre of the absurd.\nIn short, they decieve.\nPerhaps they think over the years your distance from the motherland makes you easy to manipulate, that you can’t counter their sorcery. Little do they know that as you grow up and see them leech your parents and other less fortunate loved ones, they’ve taught you valuable lessons. Coupled with the drama of dismounting the stead, you can see the wisps of their sorcery a mile away.\nYou’ve now strategically placed spikes around you. You’ve come to enjoy the world in monochrome, maybe even started adding your own colour in places. You’ve made your own throne now of gilded moments forged in the fires of tomorrow to become shimmering memories one day. All the while you sit there and admire the dance of your spikes poking out the many translucent cages that your would-be loved ones have around them.\nThey plummet into the abyss as you sit and smile for a change.\nMy advice to whoever is reading this is, when you get the chance to have that smile make sure you savour it for you’ve earned it. Be weary of that sudden shift in the air when the horizon starts to tilt, it comes when you least expect it. We’ve built magnanimous realms in our heads with thrones and plinths for all of those who we assume love us, those who we assume are our well wishers, who we assume wouldn’t harm us. But this throne room of ours is mostly full of empty vessels that shatter to the tiniest prick.\nFill your thrones with those who truly love you, who would leave you with fond memories, and hopefully have a seatbelt on the saddle. Don’t fill it with relatives who can never relate.\n","date":"Dec 25","permalink":"https://blog.hakmal.com/post/how-to-tell-a-horse/","tags":["advice","life"],"title":"How to tell a horse from its 💩"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"https://blog.hakmal.com/articles/","tags":null,"title":"Articles"}]
