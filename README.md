# Hello there!👋🏼

Welcome to a page you probably shouldn't be seeing since this is the kitchen area and not the resturant because...

## This is just a blog

If you've poked around the Internet and found your way here then welcome to the backend of my personal blog. This is just a place to drop some words and hopefully make some sense of them. ~~If you're interested in how this works, I've written a post explaining the setup~~ (still writing that). For more information about me you can also go to my [website](https://haiderali.co/). I'm a speculative designer and teacher in Australia working in AI, design futures, play theory, and the occasional robot.

*PS. If you're one of my students, I'm liking the curiosity here.*
