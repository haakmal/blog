This was partly because I would have something to quickly write about while it was still fresh in my mind, but also so I could stick to a habit of writing. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a schedule in mind for how often I intend to post here (yet), but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that with these first few technical posts I can get in the swing of it better.</description></item><item><title>Obligatory 'hello world' post</title><link>https://blog.haiderali.co/post/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.haiderali.co/post/hello-world/</guid><description>What is this place? Why hello there! (He says in his best Obi Wan voice)
Welcome to this blog. As is my cultural tradition I should have something spread out for guests like sweets or a beverage. Bare with me while I gather things here, this is my first post after all and there is still some scaffolding around the place. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is a right of passage in any way, I&amp;rsquo;ve made and forgotten many blogs in the past.</description></item></channel></rss>
