This was partly because I would have something to quickly write about while it was still fresh in my mind, but also so I could stick to a habit of writing. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a schedule in mind for how often I intend to post here (yet), but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that with these first few technical posts I can get in the swing of it better.</description></item></channel></rss>
