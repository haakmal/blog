I have an obscure fear of loosing my mind! As silly as that might sound there is a word for it dementophobia or the fear of madness.

This is me, with an ominous hand over my head. Back then I didnâ€™t know the many meanings of shit that I do today. I was born in Dubai, though not my homeland it was home for me.
